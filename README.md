>
> ### [Screen](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Y3RZQKW6f4i0rgl5_qHL5zVRfceDAsk/view)

> Points to consider
>
> - Minimum use of margin and padding
> - All cells should be clickable and should show corresponding alert
> - In case a cell is not visible it means it will scroll horizontally (Check Interaction Video)
> - Use icon8.com to get required icons
> - Create a separate repo
> - Follow the structure and naming conventions as told in class
> - Copy and paste code, you will be marked 0
> - Check [interaction video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y_SBKihJvb79jxIkmxiB2XdrilxVgUCS/view) for better understanding
> - Bottom Tab navigation should show alert on every icon clicked
